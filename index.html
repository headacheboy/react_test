  <h3>Sense-Aware Neural Models for Pun Location in Texts</h3>
  <p class="abstract"> A homographic pun is a form of wordplay in which one signifier (usually a word) suggests two or more meanings by exploiting polysemy for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. In this paper, we focus on the task of pun location, which aims to identify the pun word in a given short text. We propose a sense-aware neural model to address this challenging task. Our model first obtains several WSD results for the text, and then leverages a bidirectional LSTM network to model each sequence of word senses. The outputs at each time step for different LSTM networks are then concatenated for prediction. Evaluation results on the benchmark SemEval 2017 dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. </p>
  
  <h3> Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection in Twitter with Hierarchical Fusion Model </h3>
  <p class="abstract">Sarcasm is a subtle form of language in which people express the opposite of what is implied. Previous works of sarcasm detection focused on texts. However, more and more social media platforms like Twitter allow users to create multi-modal messages, including texts, images, and videos. It is insufficient to detect sarcasm from multi-model messages based only on texts. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal sarcasm detection for tweets consisting of texts and images in Twitter. We treat text features, image features and image attributes as three modalities and propose a multi-modal hierarchical fusion model to address this task. Our model first extracts image features and attribute features, and then leverages attribute features and bidirectional LSTM network to extract text features. Features of three modalities are then reconstructed and fused into one feature vector for prediction. We create a multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset based on Twitter. Evaluation results on the dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model and the usefulness of the three modalities.</p>
  
  <h3>Multi-domain sentiment classification based on domain-aware embedding and attention</h3>
  <p class='abstract'>Sentiment classification is a fundamental task in NLP. However, as revealed by many researches, sentiment classification models are highly domaindependent. It is worth investigating to leverage data from different domains to improve the classification performance in each domain. In this work, we propose a novel completely-shared multidomain neural sentiment classification model to learn domain-aware word embeddings and make use of domain-aware attention mechanism. Our model first utilizes BiLSTM for domain classification and extracts domain-specific features for words, which are then combined with general word embeddings to form domain-aware word embeddings. Domain-aware word embeddings are fed into another BiLSTM to extract sentence features. The domain-aware attention mechanism is used for selecting significant features, by using the domainaware sentence representation as the query vector. Evaluation results on public datasets with 16 different domains demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. Further experiments show the generalization ability and the transferability of our model.</p>
